You have to drag the droplet to you Finder toolbar before using it.

I took the skeleton of the droplet from the OpenInTextMate script found here http://henrik.nyh.se/2007/10/open-in-textmate-from-leopard-finder and the icon is from http://henrik.nyh.se/2007/10/open-terminal-here-and-glob-select-in-leopard-finder.
